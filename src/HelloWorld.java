public class HelloWorld {

//Create an int variable named myFavoriteNumber and assign your favorite number to it,
        int myFavoriteNumber = 32;
//then print it out to the console.
        System.out.println(myFavoriteNumber);
//2. Create a String variable named myString and assign a string value to it
        String myString = "This is my string";
//3. Change your code to assign a character value to myString. What do you notice; the error string can't be converted to char
//char myCharString = (char) myString;

//4. Change your code to assign the value 3.14159 to myString. What happens? This will cause an error due to a double being provided, but a string is required.
//        String myString = 3.14159;

//then print the variable out to the console.
        System.out.println(myString);
//5. Declare a long variable named myNumber, but do not assign anything to it.
//      long myNumber = ;
//Next try to print out myNumber to the console. What happens? This doesn't work because nothing was initialized since it was left blank
//      System.out.println(myNumber);
// 6. Change your code to assign the value 3.14 to myNumber. What do you notice? error due to providing a double number and not a long
//       long myNumber = 3.14;
//7. Change your code to assign the value 123L (Note the 'L' at the end) to myNumber.
//        long myNumber = 123L;
//        System.out.println(myNumber);
//8. Change your code to assign the value 123 to myNumber.
        long myNumber = 123;
//        System.out.println(myNumber);
//9. Change your code to declare myNumber as a float. Assign the value 3.14 to it.
//         float myNumber = 3.14;
// What happens? What are two ways we could fix this? assign a new variable name and use double
//10. execute the code below
// this block
//        int x = 5;
//will output 5 first because the x is before the increment
//        System.out.println(x++);
// will output 6 because the increment has happened in the line above and now x is 6
//        System.out.println(x);

//        int x = 5;
// this will output 6 first because the increment happens before the x
//        System.out.println(++x);
// this will still output 6 because the increment happened prior to the x
//        System.out.println(x);
//11. Try to create a variable named class. What happens?it doesn't work because it's a reserved word
//        string class = "will this work?"
//12. Object is the most generic type in Java. You can assign any value to a variable of type Object. What do you think will happen when the following code is run?
